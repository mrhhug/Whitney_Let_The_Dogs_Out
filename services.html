					<h4 style="text-align:left;">Meet and Greet</h4>
					<p>This is a free consultation in your home.  It is a great time to establish relationships with you and your loved ones!  It gives me an opportunity to answer your questions and also includes going over your pets routines and what they like and need as well as how much love and pets I can give them.  This is also a chance to get to know your household and information such as trash and recycling collection, newspaper and mail preferences, any restricted areas for the pets, litter boxes or crates, etc. and security systems.  Once we go through these important aspects, we will develop a customized service plan that fits your needs and allows your pets the best experience while you are away.  We also outline dates and times my services are needed- I will be caring for your house and loved ones so this is why it is essential to meet in person (and bond with the big or little ones).</p>
					<p style="font-style: italic;">*Pricing for services is based on number of pets and type of plan.  Slumber parties and vacation packages are priced per day, per animal.  Daytime visits and walking services are individual packages that we can also price out for long term options!</p>
					<h4 style="text-align:left;">Slumber Party</h4>
					<p>This is an overnight service that ensures lots of cuddles are given whenever your pets need it!  While you are away I can assist with mail, trash, and watering stand alone plants in addition to caring for your pets.  Whether it’s a weekend away or a month, it’s specially designed to fit your needs and their routines.</p>
					<h4 style="text-align:left;">Vacation Packages</h4>
					<p>If you are away and need someone to stop in 1, 2, or 3 times per day without the overnight stay, all of your pets food, bathroom, medication, and exercise needs will be met!  This is great too if you have cats that may be more independent and don’t need the slumber party!</p>
					<h4 style="text-align:left;">Daytime Visits</h4>
					<p>For those days you are working longer hours and the pets need a midday break!  I can also take care of their dietary needs if necessary and give them some play time!  These are midday visits between 11-2 typically but I can also do evening visits in case you are running late to get home to them.</p>
					<h4 style="text-align:left;">Dog Walking </h4>
					<p>If your dog needs a quick walk or a long stroll, I will make sure they are wagging their tails along the way.  Walks are scheduled between 11-2 and include refilling water, and both potty and dietary needs.  Walks are either 20 or 40 minutes in length, but if your needs differ I am more than happy to comply!</p>
